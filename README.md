8 HOURS of work  

#### **Challenges or Issues Encountered:**
 - The block navigation system. It only avoids one block for now. Needs more time to be perfected  

#### **Features:**
 - Created in minecraft version 1.20.2
 - Alert the player when the chest is full
 - Block navigation system
 - Simple particle effects when breaking woods
 - Floats in water
 - Interaction effect with sponge/ice
 - Destroyed when in contact with flowers/fern/mushroom etc.
 - Detection system if the target tree is already taken by another machine
 - 5 up to 50 meter radius scan to avoid server lag
 - Diamond speed = 10 ticks / 0.5 seconds
 - Emerald speed = 20 ticks / 1 second
 - Gold speed = 30 ticks / 1.5 seconds

I can make this plugin perfect if given enough time. Only created the basics and don't  
have any way to save the machines yet.
